This classification problem aims to predict the class label for each node based on their features and the relationships they have with other nodes.

*This is a course project for CSE 881 Data Mining at MSU. Since it is a competition among teams and we will be evaluated (and graded) based on accuracy, the code cannot be shared until the final grading has been concluded.
